Advantages of this system, and why it is attractive to develop

### Keeps the cell alive
This technique does not require cell lysis, enabling the study of a cell over time, with repeated measurements possible without murdering the cell

### many complementary tags theoretically possible
The fact that each enzyme catalyses a separate reaction, means that they do not interfere with each other, meaning many tags are simultaneously possible, while when working with fluorescence, fluorescence overlap can make result in fluorescence quentching
