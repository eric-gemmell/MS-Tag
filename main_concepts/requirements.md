### Sensitivity of the MS detector

Apparently LC-MS systems tend to be sensitive to about pg.ml^-1 and the injection volume is about 1μL.
This means that an LC-MS machine can detect a femto gram of material.
Going with concentration, lets assume our molecule is 300 Da mass, pretty standard. Then we need a 3-4 * 10^-12 molar solution 

So we need 1μL at 5 * 10^-12 M solution for each bacteria

Volume of my typical bacteria: 0.6–0.7 μm^3 or 0.6-7 femtoliters (0.6 * 10^-15 L), a microliter is more than 10^9 times bigger.
