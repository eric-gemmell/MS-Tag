This text describes common issues encountered with fusion proteins, that we should be making a lookout for when developing these tools

### Impact on Cellular Processes: 
The size and nature of the attached protein (which can be relatively large and bulky) might affect cellular processes, especially if the POI plays a role in fine cellular mechanisms or is part of large complexes.

### Issues of Overexpression
When a particular protein might be being monitored, maybe a user wants to over express that POI, what happens to our tag? is it going to coagulate and be funky? or is it going to behave?
