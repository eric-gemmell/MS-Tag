This enzyme catalyses the conversion of 2S,3S methylaspartic Acid to Mesaconic Acid, while releasing ammonia. The reaction seems quite attractive as both are small molecules that should be readily transported in and out of the cell. 

One problem however is that these are charged molecules that may have a harddd time flowing between the inside and out of the cell. They may also be hard to detect by mass spec as a loss of 18 amu might be too standard to detect by mass spec. Also these compounds might just be used by standard bacterial metabolism, so they may have an impact on standard cell performance.

Also, if it requires a cofactor, which it very well might require cobamide, then this enzyme might not be viable.

Also, protein is quite large, and if it requires itself to be a dimmer in order to function, then no way.
