This is a very attractive enzyme as DCM will be super permeable to the cell membrane and might be quite detectable by MS (though probably not)

### Problems with this enzyme
The product formaldehyde is problematic due to its high reactivity, and toxicity, in that it conjugates with amines, and also polymerises by itself.
Making this small molecule not as innert as we would have hoped.
