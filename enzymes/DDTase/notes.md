### Attractive Properties
 - Small molecule starting material and product should be detectable by mass spec quite easily
 - Small molecules have no biological effect
 - Change in mass characteristic of the reaction
 - molecules should both be membrane permeable

### Unattractive Properties
 - Enzyme requires glutathione as a cofactor (this might not be the end of the world if it is catalytic not stoichiometric)
 - Not a small enzyme
