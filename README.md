# Mass Spec based molecular taging

This project describes my attempts at finding suitable small protein tags that catalyse with high rate specific reactions that can be easily checked by Mass Spec

## Properties of the ideal enzyme
 - Does not interact in any way or impact the function of the attached POI
 - High catalytic rate for the desired sensor molecule
 - Does not catalyse any other reaction other than the intended reaction
 - Does not interfere with the normal function of the cell or any cellular processes

## Useful properties to have
 - Thermal and pH stability
 - Can be cleaved off if ever trying to purify
 - Small proteins might be better
