# Mass Spec based molecular taging

This project describes my attempts at finding suitable small protein tags that catalyse with high rate specific reactions that can be easily checked by Mass Spec

## Why is this project interesting?
Few analytical systems exist that can work on individual cells to monitor gene expression. In addition most of these techniques require incredibly complex analytical tools that are expensive and difficult to set and require a lot of calibration. The goal of this project is to create a monitoring system for certain genes in the cell that can be forgotten about and then measured when need be 

## Properties of the ideal enzyme
 - Does not interact in any way or impact the function of the attached POI
 - Does not impact expression of the POI
 - High catalytic rate for the desired sensor molecule
 - Does not catalyse any other reaction other than the intended reaction
 - Does not interfere with the normal function of the cell or any cellular processes
 - Does not require any cofactors in order to function

## Properties of the ideal small molecule tag
 - Neither of the starting material or product have any effect or natural function within the cell
 - Does not have any major absorbance in the visible or UV part of the spectrum, such that other assays can be run simultaneously
 - Small molecule
 - High membrane permeability but inability to permeate the oil in water emulsions used in uHT Screens

## Useful properties to have
 - Thermal and pH stability
 - Can be cleaved off if ever trying to purify
 - Small proteins might be better (less than 30 kDa or 250 AA)
